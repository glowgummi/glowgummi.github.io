        Chocolate Mousse Cups
    </h1>
    <i class="fa-solid fa-mug-saucer"></i>
    <p> 
        For all my chocolate lovers, these mousse cups are the ultimate silky, 
        rich, spoon-worthy treat. They look fancy but come together with just a 
        few simple steps and a quick chill. Every bite is light, creamy, and so 
        chocolatey and I have a feeling you're going to be obsessed.

            <li>In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, add the heavy cream,

            <li> Uncover and whisk from the center outward until completely

                gently folding after each addition until the mousse is light
                and airy.</li>

        Ripple Fries-Sweet Green Copycat
    </h1>
    <p>
        These ripple fries are my take on the viral Sweetgreen ones but made at
        home and even better. They're crispy on the outside, soft on the inside,
        and made in the air fryer without the mess of deep frying. Just a few 
        simple ingredients and you've got the perfect crispy snack or side dish.

    <h2>
        Ingredients
    </h2>
     <p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes (2 medium potatoes)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons avocado oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
       Instructions
    </h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
        <li>Start by washing your potatoes, scrubbing them well. We'll be 
            keeping the skins on for an authentic copycat but if you prefer it
            without, just peel the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Slice the potatoes using a crinkle cutter into pieces just a little 
            under 1/4 inch thick. Place the slices in a bowl of cold water and 
            let them soak for at 20 to 30 minutes — this helps make them extra 
            crispy. After soaking, drain and pat them <b><i> completely </i></b>
            dry with a clean towel.</li>
        <li>Toss the potato slices with avocado oil, cornstarch, salt, and black
            pepper until everything is evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Preheat your air fryer to 375°F and add the fries in a single layer,
            preferabbly on a wire rack so air can circulate. This will depend on
            the style of air fryer you have.</li>
        <li>Air fry for 20 to 25 minutes, flipping halfway through. Spray with a
            little more avocado oil while they cook if needed, until golden
            brown and crisp.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce!</li>
