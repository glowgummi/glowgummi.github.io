        Chocolate Mousse Cups

    <p> 
        For all my chocolate lovers, these mousse cups are the ultimate silky, 
        rich, spoon-worthy treat. They look fancy but come together with just a 
        few simple steps and a quick chill. Every bite is light, creamy, and so 
        chocolatey and I have a feeling you're going to be obsessed.

        <ol>
            <li> Add the Oreos to a food processor and pulse until very fine 
                crumbs form. </li>
            <li>Transfer the crumbs to a mixing bowl. Pour in the melted butter

    <h4> 
        CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
    </h4>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>  Place the chopped chocolate in a medium heat-safe bowl.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, add the heavy cream,
                butter, and sugar. Whisk until the mixture is hot and the sugar
                is dissolved, but do not let it boil.</li>
            <li> Pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate, cover the bowl,
                and let it sit undisturbed for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Uncover and whisk from the center outward until completely
                smooth and glossy. Let it cool slightly so it's warm but not 
                hot.</li>
            <li> Whisk in the egg yolks until fully combined.</li>
            <li> Add the espresso powder, vanilla extract, and a tiny pinch of 
                salt, then whisk again until smooth.</li>
            <li> In a separate bowl, whip the chilled heavy cream with a hand 
                mixer or whisk until soft peaks form.</li>
            <li> Add the whipped cream to the chocolate mixture in batches,
                gently folding after each addition until the mousse is light
                and airy.</li>
            <li> Cover the mousse, trasnfer to the fridge, and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
        <h4> 
        CHANTILLY CREAM
    </h4>
    <p>
        <ol>
        <li>In a clean bowl, add the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla
            extract.</li>
        <li>Whip with a hand mixer or whisk until soft peaks form.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4> 
        Assemble
    </h4>
    <p>
        <ol>
        <li>Add a few spoonfuls of the crust mixture to the bottom of each cup
            and press down lightly to form an even layer.</li>
        <li>Spoon or pipe the chocolate mousse on top so each cup fills about 
            two-thirds to three-quarters of the way up.</li>
        <li>Finish the remaining space with Chantilly or whipped cream.</li>
        <li>Enjoy right away, or cover each jar and refrigerate for up to 3
            days.</li>
