        <p><b> Crown Shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup>
        canopy shyness,</i>,<i><sup>[2]</sup>or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3] 
        </sup>)</i> is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the
        crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy 
        with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup> The phenomenon is 
        most prevalent among trees of the same species,but also occurs between 
        trees of different species.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup>There exist many
        hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior,and research
        suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>
